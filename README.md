This is a simple application that allows users to enter recipe names, instructions on how to prepare the recipes, and needed ingredients.

Once a recipe has been created, its details may be
edited via a modal that opens when any recipe card is clicked.

Users may enter text into an input, which will filter the recipes by their titles.

Recipes and ingredients may be deleted by users. Recipes will persist in localStorage.
