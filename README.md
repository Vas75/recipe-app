This is a simple application that allows users to enter recipe names, instructions on how to prepare the recipes, and needed ingredients. Once a recipe has been created, its details may be
edited via a modal that opens when any recipe card is clicked. Recipes and ingredients may be deleted by users. Recipes will persist in localStorage.
